title: "Crime Rates"
---

Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate crime rates using R and the Tidyverse. We'll also introduce a new library, janitor, which helps make column names easier to work with. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.





















When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
